She is a Japanese-English singer-songwriter who has recently come out as pansexual, and has become sort of an icon of representation for queer Asian women who grow up in Western societies like in the UK or the US. \nTo me, as someone who falls into this demographic, I find Rina and the culture of music she creates fascinating as a way to rewrite our representation in a world that previously has not made room for it. The sound of her music resembles that of early 2000s pop (think Britney Spears and NSync), and she repurposes it with messages about queerness, politics, and technology. A lot of the aesthetics around her music, the merch, and the graphic design also borrow the cyberpunk, turn-of-the-century visual elements from this time period.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ORDINARY SUPERSTAR TOUR<br><br>TICKETS AVAILABLE NOW: <a href=\"https://t.co/hdPwDtGneR\">https://t.co/hdPwDtGneR</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/q0l8XWt64u\">pic.twitter.com/q0l8XWt64u</a></p>&mdash; RINA SAWAYAMA üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàüáØüáµ (@rinasawayama) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rinasawayama/status/1005149831281758209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 8, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MERCH DROP 7PM GMT TUESDAY 10TH<br><br>RINA mini album vinyl - exclusive to the online shop<br>ALTERLIFE T shirts orange and white - last EVER run<br>Cyber Rina POPSOCKETS (new!!)<br><br>SHIPPING WORLDWIDE <a href=\"https://t.co/k2MuVkEt9m\">https://t.co/k2MuVkEt9m</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zX0JT8aibk\">pic.twitter.com/zX0JT8aibk</a></p>&mdash; RINA SAWAYAMA üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàüáØüáµ (@rinasawayama) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rinasawayama/status/1015577599249174528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 7, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nWhen I grew up, Britney Spears was the first real music artist that I was aware of. I didn't really know of any big musical artists in the US who were Asian, and who looked like I did. I think for me, the appeal of Rina Sawayama's music and the visual culture around it is that it reimagines what it would be like if Asian Americans did grow up with pop stars as big as Britney Spears, who looked the way we did. The 2000s aesthetics is a way to transport us back into that time and write in that missing history.\n\n## My \"Tour Poster\"\n\nRina Sawayama's visual aesthetic is already pretty distinct, and I wanted to use the spirit of her style -  which channels early 2000s graphic design and elements of collective childhood nostalgia - to create an interpretation of my own.\n\n![Tour poster](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/2uK81ZbWNG2cHslmM5Jh7O/32752b3a4e235bab0d5d5f03d1bec524/Tour_poster.png)\n\n\n### Type Choices\n\nI used a [Powerpuff Girls Font](https://www.dafont.com/powerpuff-girls.font) for the heading, because that personally captures an era of nostalgia and early 2000s aesthetics. I grew up watching Powerpuff Girls as a very young child - about the same time I became conscious of what Pop Music was. I also think the feminist undertones of the cartoon are really fitting for Sawayama's aesthetic.\n\nI also used a free font called [Magenta](https://www.dafont.com/magenta.font) that I felt captured a cyber, 2000s look.\n\n### \"3D Graphics\" \nI wanted to explore blobby, CGI aesthetics that were often used in graphic design during this time period. For this I used a tool called [Sculpt GL](https://stephaneginier.com/sculptgl/), which easily allows you to sculpt a 3D object within the browser and add an image as a texture. My 3D knowledge is not the most elaborated at this point of my life, so I opted to use a quick tool as opposed to a more elaborate one. I screenshotted results from this online tool and photoshopped them to work within a poster.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-18 at 3.36.56 PM](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/CicTahsnKyzgmTg9C8DNr/8ce8caa98ff63e90c8ab9d2b063900f5/Screen_Shot_2019-09-18_at_3.36.56_PM.png)\n\n### Other notes \n\n- I used a Matrix-like background and changed the colors - I definitely think the Matrix aesthetic is coming back into today's graphic design. I think there are also questions there about how repurposing those visuals can possibly ask questions about equality and representation in the \"hacker\" subculture.\n- I included some cherry blossoms to allude to Sawayama's coming out song, [Cherry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn5YFnrD1u8).\n- Unfortunately I got a bit lazy with the tour dates/cities and ended up copy and pasting repeated cities, so that's something I could go back and refine if I really wanted this to be a high-fidelity tour poster.\n- The image of Rina is from here: http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/eight-pop-stars-to-stan-in-2019/175545/attachment/rina-sawayama\n\n","createdAt":"2019-09-18T19:49:55.295Z","tags":[{"name":"Designing Club Cultures"}]}},{"node":{"id":"5grWCuO749y6uphDAyU6KV","title":"Creating my own song-inspired \"Niche Memes\"","bodyText":"## Prompt\nCreate 3 different sculptures (physical and/or digital) based off 3 different songs in this playlist.

They can function as different purposes, like a personal diary, or putting together an outfit vision/mood board, or even as a wishlist. The common images included are everyday objects girls might own or use through the day - clothes, cell phone covers, or iced lattes.\n\n![IMG 1910](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/6SgQQTWC8PecdyaHlDkovi/3ab4ca8c6fee9a6ab811eaf9ea9a9770/IMG_1910.PNG)\n\n\n\nIn particular, ones that remind me of this exercise are ones that define aesthetics around particular decades or music artists/genres, and imagine what the outfits, accessories, etc, of people who are fans of them might be. A lot of these are titled ‚ÄúIf ____ was a teen‚Äù.\n\nThis format is fascinating because:\n\n1. Gen-Z culture is really otherworldly to me, as someone who is barely on the cusp of being categorized as Gen-Z.\n\n2.  I‚Äôm interested in how this kind of teen subculture (that‚Äôs enabled by the internet, in particular Instagram) relates to broader ideas of subculture. Is there any degree of resistance or empowerment in this? What are the identities of the teens who are making these, across race and class and sexual orientations? Is there any relationship between the consumerism of these (a lot of them include collages of popular makeup products and fashionable clothes) and the privilege of the teens who are making these collages?\n\nSome of them make aesthetic collages around certain time periods, like here for example. There is a degree of stereotyping and imagination in these: after all, they‚Äôre what someone born likely after the year 2000 imagines about eras long before they were alive.\n\nWhat does it look for me to make my own Niche Memes about these 3 chosen songs from this weeks prompt? How can this format be repurposed to avoid simply giving a shallow interpretation of what a subculture was like, and instead provide some educational aspect?\n\nMy Own ‚ÄúNiche Memes‚Äù for Club Cultures\n\n![IMG F07B98E54F99-1](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/2i0Cgtvr7xkcxaMEgsnT9O/ba6e18e3af5d531d0103218e1c145a84/IMG_F07B98E54F99-1.jpeg)\n\n*Purple Haze - Jimi Hendrix*\n\n‚ÄúHe explained later that the idea for the words to \"Purple Haze\" came to him in a dream after he had read a science fiction novel.‚Äú\n\n‚ÄòWhile Hendrix rarely expressed himself in racial terms, Vernon Reid says he totally changed the parameters of what black art could be.\n\n\"He was unabashedly sexual,\" says Reid. \"He didn't apologize to black people for being wild, and he didn't apologize ‚Äî he certainly didn't ask for permission from white people.

(presumably) Like many of these teens, I also don‚Äôt have a strong working knowledge of these specific eras and cultural movements, so I did a little rudimentary research on each of these songs and artists to explore what were the context of these pieces.\n\nSources / Research\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2000/09/18/1088122/jimi-hendrix-purple-haze\n\n+ wikipedia","createdAt":"2019-09-13T21:40:08.216Z","tags":[{"name":"Designing Club Cultures"}]}},{"node":{"id":"5ogvCQbqsZIICrWLz0E40f","title":"First blog post","bodyText":"text of first blog post\n\n![cover](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1QxeHA8itBTC63IfrlAI2z/dc21556834ace67b37071d53690f0845/cover.png)","createdAt":"2019-09-12T01:56:19.909Z","tags":[{"name":"Designing Club Cultures"}]}}]}},"context":{"id":"3mht7Hh8NfD7SvNCDiPVRb","name":"Understanding Networks"}}
